## Disney Movies and Box Office Success

Explore Disney movie data, then build a linear regression model to predict box office success.

### Project Description
Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, I analyzed data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. I also performed hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.

This project use Pandas to manipulate data using pandas and Seaborn to create visualization plots. This project also familiarized myself with statistical inference and helped me perform two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for difference of means.

#### The dataset used in this project is a modified version of the Disney Character Success dataset from Kelly Garrett.

The project is a part of my personal learning process at Datacamp.
